# 🚔 Crimetrack BI using SQL & Power BI

## 📖 Project Title: Crimetrack BI using SQL & Power BI

## 🔍 Introduction
This project is focused on analyzing crime data using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to understand trends in criminal activity, study patterns among offenders and victims, and assess how many cases are resolved or left open. This kind of analysis helps police, researchers, and the public understand where and why crimes happen, and how they can be prevented.
